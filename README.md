This is a simple calculator for doing mathematical operations.
In this project I have used react for the view layer and redux for state management. Beacuse we did not use any async operation so we did not use any middleware as well.

This project can be beneficial to understand the basic concepts of state management in redux.

### `Credits`
1. I have used css from [Here](https://codepen.io/CodesAndJazz/pen/dXazYj)
2. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
